To compile:
    gcc -Wall *.c -rdynamic -ldl -lpthread -o ircbotd

Any modules must be placed in the "./modules" subdirectory.
Logs are stored in the "./logs" subdirectory
Default configuration file is ./ircbotd.conf; a custom one may be set
through flags:

ircbotd -c conffile

To make custom modules:

- Include at least circle.h
- Implement the following prototype, or else the module will not be loaded:
            void evaluate(IRCMSG * ircmsg);
        Take a look at circle.h to see what is in the custom data types.
- Please use the following prototype for writing output to the stream:
            void ircmsg->irc->respond(ircmsg->irc, const char * format, ...);
        this allows for proper signaling to the parent thread to send/flush the stream;
        format is the string format, similar to the printf family of functions
- To compile:
        gcc -Wall -fPIC -shared *.c -o libcustommod.so
- Placing this in the "./modules" directory on ircbotd startup will cause it to be automatically
        loaded; placed anywhere else, you can still load it while ircbotd is running by sending
            !module load libcustommod.so
        for example.

Note: be warned that creating your own modules increases the risk that your bot	may segfault.
